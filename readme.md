# Cat Collector

### Learning Django

During this 2 week long codealong we will add features, piece-by-piece, to a modern full-stack reference app named CatCollector.

**Each days completed code will be added to its own branch so you can reference each stage in the process.**

Then, after the lessons, you will use lab time to repeat what you saw in the lesson by building your own app named anything you want,i.e. - **(Finch)Collector**.

Here's an overview of the high-level topics we'll be covering, in order:

  1. Django URLs, Views, and Templates
  2. Data Models and Migrations
  3. Django Class-based Views
  4. One-to-Many Models & ModelForms
  5. Many-to-Many Models
  6. Uploading Images to the Cloud
  7. Django Authentication# catcollector
